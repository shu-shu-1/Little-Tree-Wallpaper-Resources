# Little Tree Wallpaper Resources

[中文说明](README_zh.md)

> 🌳 A registry for plugins, themes, and wallpaper sources of **Little Tree Wallpaper**.

---

## 📌 Purpose

This repository provides **metadata files** (TOML/JSON).  
For v3, it is **recommended** to store distributable files (e.g. plugin/theme packages, icons) under `src/` and reference them by **repo-relative paths**.

This repository still **does NOT host actual wallpaper contents**.

You can think of it as a "**store catalog**" or "**app store index**" for Little Tree Wallpaper.
